# CS6704 SE Basics Workshop
### Ritvik Prabhu
Hello Github!

## Part 6: Project Management
### Standup overview

Participants: Shawal Khalid(shawal<at>vt<dot>edu), Ritvik Prabhu(ritvikp<at>vt<dot>edu)

Ritvik went first and talked about his progress in this workshop. He was able to complete almost all of the parts of the workshop except the standup (which was taking place at the time). He completed the Bash milestone, coding milestone (Int to Roman program was implemented), Git milestone and the API milestone. For the scripts on the API section, he created a script to get a user's starred repos and a script to retrieve all the open issues in a GitHub repo. For the Project Management portion, he created an issue (https://github.com/CS6704-VT/Basics-Workshop/issues/6), and built the project workflow. As mentioned earlier, the task that needs to be done to complete this task is the stand-up and uploading of his code into Shawal's repo (on a separate branch). His blocker was waiting on Shawal to complete the creation of her Github repo, however, the effect of the blocker is not dire.

Shawal went next and talked about what she does outside of class. She mentioned that she has been lecturing her Software engineering class, doing the workshop homework in this special studies class and making significant progress on her research. For things to do, she needs to complete the workshop homework and prepare a workshop for her class. Her blocker is that she is overloaded with work so she is finding it hard to manage her time effectively.
